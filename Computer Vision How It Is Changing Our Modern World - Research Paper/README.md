<h2 align="center">Computer Vision: How it is Changing Our Modern World</h2>
<p align="justify">Computer Vision: The growing field of computer vision lies at the heart of a multitude of various modern technologies. The amount of visual data collected continues to rise, making computer vision an essential tool for processing and organizing visual data. It incorporates several of the methods used by data 
scientists, including clustering, anomaly detection, association-rule mining, and prediction. This technology is a driving force across different domains. Major companies, including Google, Facebook, and Amazon, have invested heavily in this technology while inspiring innovations such as Teslaâ€™s self-driving cars, reCAPTCHA verification systems, and advances in medicine. In this project, we will conduct a general survey of the field of computer vision, explore how the technology works, assess its current challenges, and discuss how different industries put computer vision into action. Using computer vision, data scientists have an opportunity to optimize the flood of visual data to meet the needs of our global community.
