<h2 align="center">Heart Disease Prediction</h2>
<p align="justify">Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Growing numbers of heart disease in young/mid-age population are alarming. Machine learning techniques can be used to predict possibilities of heart disease so that appropriate actions can be taken to prevent them.
