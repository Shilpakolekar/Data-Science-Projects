<h2 align="center">Auto Insurance Rate Prediction Model</h2>
<p align="justify">Insurance companies need to understand their customers' characteristics to determine how much rate they should charge based on risks associated. If a customer is prone to get into accidents and cause claims, it might be appropriate to charge them higher rate. If a customers are safe and the chances of them getting into accidents are low, then it might be appropriate to charge them lower rate. Machine learning models can examine customer characterstics and predict the potential of whether customers can get into accidents or not. Using this information, insurance companies can determine the auto insurance rate for customers.</p>
