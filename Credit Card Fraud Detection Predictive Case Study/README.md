<h2 align="center">Credit Card Fraud Detection Predictive Case Study</h2>
<p align="justify">Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is like looking for a needle in haystack. There are millions of credit card transactions daily. It is not possible for human to scan these many transactions and detect fraud. For this reason, the machine learning techniques are widely used in the field of fraud detection. Credit card fraud detection model extracts information from large credit card dataset, scans each transaction, and provides a list of fraudulent transactions. This model provides hundreds of fraudulent transactions from the list of millions which cuts down human work drastically. This case study uses fields of Statistics, Pattern Recognition, and Data Mining to predict credit card fraud detection.
