<h2 align="center">Customer Segmentation</h2>
<p align="justify">It is important for the organizations to know which customers are expected to purchase what products, so that the customers can be targeted accordingly. Customers with similar characteristics typically show similar purchase behavior. If the customers can be segmented into clusters, then it would be easy for them to be targeted based on their needs. By doing so, the organizations can optimize the money spent on marketing and help improve profit margins. Machine learning techniques can help with customer segmentation.
